# MongoDB $inc Operator Error with String Value

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB: attempting to increment a field with a string value instead of a numerical value. The `$inc` operator is designed to increment numerical fields only, and passing a string value results in unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the correct implementation.
